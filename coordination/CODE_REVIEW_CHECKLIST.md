- [ ] **Rate limiting considerations** - API protection mechanisms in place

### AI Integration Standards (if applicable)
- [ ] **Provider abstraction maintained** - Unified interface for AI services
- [ ] **Cost optimization implemented** - Token usage efficient, fallback strategies
- [ ] **Error handling robust** - Graceful degradation when AI services fail
- [ ] **Response validation** - AI responses parsed and validated properly

## Documentation & Maintainability

### Code Documentation
- [ ] **JSDoc comments for public functions** - APIs documented with parameters and returns
- [ ] **Complex logic explained** - Non-obvious code has explanatory comments

- [ ] **API documentation current** - Swagger/OpenAPI specs updated if applicable

### Change Documentation
- [ ] **Git commit messages descriptive** - Clear description of what and why
- [ ] **Pull request description complete** - Summary, testing notes, breaking changes
- [ ] **Migration notes included** - Database or breaking changes documented
- [ ] **Environment variable changes** - New .env requirements documented

## Performance & Scalability

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] **Page load times acceptable** - Under 3 seconds for initial load
- [ ] **API response times reasonable** - Under 200ms for simple queries
- [ ] **Database query performance** - No N+1 queries, proper indexing
- [ ] **Bundle size impact minimal** - New dependencies justified, tree-shaking applied

### Resource Management
- [ ] **Memory usage reasonable** - No obvious memory leaks or excessive usage
- [ ] **Network requests optimized** - Batching, caching, compression where appropriate
- [ ] **Database connections managed** - Proper connection pooling and cleanup
- [ ] **Error logging appropriate** - Sufficient for debugging, not excessive

## AI Visual Testing Integration

### Screenshot-Based Validation
- [ ] **UI components visually correct** - Screenshots verify proper rendering
- [ ] **Responsive design validated** - Mobile and desktop layouts function correctly  
- [ ] **Interactive elements functional** - Buttons, forms, navigation work as expected
- [ ] **Visual regression prevented** - No unintended UI changes introduced

### Testing Setup Compliance
- [ ] **Playwright configuration correct** - Screenshots saved to agent-specific paths
- [ ] **Agent isolation maintained** - Tests run against agent's unique environment

- [ ] **Test on different devices/browsers** - Cross-platform compatibility verified
- [ ] **Test with realistic data** - Not just "hello world" test cases
- [ ] **Test error scenarios** - Verify graceful handling of failures

### Team Coordination
- [ ] **Breaking changes communicated** - Other developers aware of changes that affect them
- [ ] **Dependencies updated safely** - Package updates tested and documented
- [ ] **Configuration changes documented** - Infrastructure or environment changes noted
- [ ] **Rollback plan considered** - Strategy for reverting changes if needed

## Review Decision Matrix

### Approve ✅
- All critical items checked
- Minor issues can be addressed in follow-up
- Feature works as specified
- Code quality meets standards

### Request Changes ❌
- Critical functionality doesn't work
- Major code quality issues
- Security vulnerabilities present
- Architecture compliance failures

### Conditional Approval ⚠️
- Minor improvements needed
- Documentation gaps
- Non-critical test failures
- Performance concerns that don't block release

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Local testing workflow
git pull origin [branch-name]
nvm use
pnpm install
pnpm run type-check
pnpm run lint
pnpm run test
pnpm run build
pnpm run dev

# Manual testing
curl -X GET http://localhost:5173/api/health
# Test specific endpoints based on changes

# Visual testing (when applicable)
pnpm run test:visual
# Check screenshot outputs in /tmp/screenshot_*
```

**Note**: This checklist should be followed for every pull request. Items marked as critical (functionality, security, architecture) are blocking - the PR cannot be approved until these are resolved. Quality and documentation items are strongly recommended but may be addressed in follow-up work if they don't impact functionality.
