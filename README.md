# Monitors! ðŸ“Š

AI-powered monitoring platform that lets you create intelligent monitors using natural language.

## Quick Start âš¡

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElChache/monitors.git
cd monitors
docker-compose up --build
```

Visit: http://localhost:5173

## What's This?

Monitors! is an AI-powered platform where you can create smart monitoring systems using natural language. Just describe what you want to monitor, and our AI will:

- Understand your intent (stock prices, weather, website changes, etc.)
- Extract relevant entities and conditions  
- Set up automated monitoring with notifications
- Learn from patterns to improve accuracy over time

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + PostgreSQL + Redis + BullMQ
- **AI**: Claude (Anthropic) + OpenAI with intelligent failover
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose for development

## Features

### Current (Week 1)
- âœ… User authentication (JWT + Google OAuth)
- âœ… Monitor CRUD operations with REST API
- âœ… AI-powered prompt classification
- âœ… Dashboard with grid/list views, filtering, search
- âœ… Monitor creation with 4-step AI workflow
- âœ… Rate limiting and user account management
- âœ… Real-time UI updates and responsive design

### Coming Soon (Week 2-4)
- ðŸ”„ Web scraping and data collection
- ðŸ”„ Email notifications and alerts
- ðŸ”„ Historical data tracking and charts
- ðŸ”„ Advanced AI monitoring capabilities
- ðŸ”„ Template suggestions and recommendations

## Development
