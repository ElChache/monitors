- Implement performance tests for loading times and bundle size optimization
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, WebSockets) for reliable test execution
- Test accessibility features with automated tools and manual keyboard navigation

Break down larger frontend features into 1-3 hour chunks for better coordination.

## Development Process

**⚠️ CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Read and follow `coordination/AGENT_ISOLATION_PROTOCOL.md` to set up your isolated git worktree and Docker environment. This prevents conflicts with other agents working simultaneously.

### Phase 1: Preparation Phase
**Dependencies**: MUST wait for Lead Developer's `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`, `coordination/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `coordination/FE_TASKS.md`, UX Expert's `coordination/UX_INTERFACE_SPECIFICATIONS.md`, and Graphic Designer's `coordination/VISUAL_STYLE_GUIDE.md`

**Workflow**:
1. **Wait for required documents** - Periodically check these files until they exist and contain "DOCUMENT COMPLETE" at the end:
   - `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`
   - `coordination/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   - `coordination/FE_TASKS.md`
   - `coordination/UX_INTERFACE_SPECIFICATIONS.md`
   - `coordination/VISUAL_STYLE_GUIDE.md`
   Do not proceed to step 2 until all documents are complete.
2. **Study technical standards document** - Read `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md` to understand coding standards, architecture patterns, and development environment requirements
3. **Review implementation plan** - Read `coordination/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to understand overall project architecture and how frontend components fit
4. **Review your task list** - Read `coordination/FE_TASKS.md` to see all your specific frontend development tasks assigned by Lead Developer
5. **Study UX interface specifications** - Read `coordination/UX_INTERFACE_SPECIFICATIONS.md` to understand user flows, interaction patterns, and interface behavior requirements
6. **Study visual style guide** - Read `coordination/VISUAL_STYLE_GUIDE.md` to understand brand colors, typography, iconography, and visual design requirements
7. **Set up development environment** - Configure development tools and testing environment according to specifications in `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`
8. **Create test datasets** - Develop comprehensive test scenarios for component validation based on requirements in `coordination/FE_TASKS.md`
9. **Prepare for implementation** - Ensure you understand the standards, overall plan, specific tasks, UX patterns, and visual style before moving to Phase 2

### Phase 2: Implementation Phase
**Workflow**: Iterative feedback loop with Lead Developer using `coordination/FE_TASKS.md`

**Step 1: Pick Next Task**
- Review `coordination/FE_TASKS.md` for tasks assigned to you
- Select next task with status "ready"
- Update task status to "in progress"
- If there are not tasks on "ready" status, wait some minutes and read the file again.

**Step 2: Complete Task**
- Work on the task following standards from `coordination/TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md`
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- Test functionality thoroughly

**Step 3: Submit for Review**
- Update task status in `coordination/FE_TASKS.md` to "needs review"
- Add completion details to the same task entry - include working examples, test results, code locations
- Demonstrate functionality - provide evidence that components work, responsive design functions, accessibility features work

**Step 4: Review Response**
- **Wait for Lead Developer review** - Check `coordination/FE_TASKS.md` periodically for status updates on your submitted task
- **Monitor task status** - Continue checking the file every few minutes until Lead Developer updates the task status and adds review notes
- **If Lead Developer marks status as "approved"**: Move to Step 1 for next task
- **If Lead Developer marks status as "changes requested"**: Address feedback notes and return to Step 2
- **All communication happens in the task entry** within `coordination/FE_TASKS.md`
- **Do not proceed to other tasks** until current task review is complete

**Step 5: Iterate**
- Continue this cycle until all frontend development tasks in `coordination/FE_TASKS.md` are marked "approved"
- Each task must be individually approved before being considered complete

## Collaboration Notes

**Communication Method**: Follow `coordination/COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md` for detailed forum system instructions on how to coordinate with other team members.

### With Lead Developer
- Request technical guidance and implementation decisions via `coordination/FORUM.md`
- Escalate blockers and integration issues requiring leadership input
- Coordinate on code review feedback and UI/UX implementation changes
- Seek clarification on requirements and design specifications

### With Backend Developers
- Coordinate on API contracts and TypeScript interfaces via `coordination/FORUM.md`
- Test API integration and error handling
- Ensure real-time updates work correctly
- Collaborate on authentication implementation

### With UX Expert
- Clarify design specifications and edge cases via `coordination/FORUM.md`
- Provide feedback on implementation feasibility
- Coordinate on responsive behavior and interactions

## Developer Testing Requirements

**Visual Testing** (verify UI works):
```javascript
// 1. Screenshot your components
await page.screenshot({ path: `/tmp/screenshot_${agentId}_${Date.now()}.png` });

// 2. Basic interaction testing
await page.click('button');
await page.fill('input', 'test data');
await page.screenshot({ path: `/tmp/screenshot_${agentId}_${Date.now()}.png` });

// 3. Verify different states (hover, active, disabled)
```

**When to test**: After each component change, before marking task "done"
**What to verify**: Component renders, interactions work, responsive behavior
**Reference**: See `coordination/AI_VISUAL_TESTING_BASIC.md` for full setup
- Validate final implementation against designs

### With AI Developers
- Integrate AI validation feedback in monitor creation
- Handle AI service errors and loading states via `coordination/FORUM.md`
- Test AI response parsing and display
- Coordinate on user feedback for AI interactions
